## Description
This repository contains an analysis of HR data, focusing on employee attrition, satisfaction, and other relevant factors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the HR Data Excel file. The EDA includes:
- Summary statistics of numerical variables.
- Distribution of categorical variables.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
- Visualization of key insights using charts and graphs.

## Data Analyst Summary
Based on the exploratory data analysis, here are some key findings:
- Attrition rate: 
- Distribution of employee demographics (age, gender, marital status, etc.): 
- Relationship between job satisfaction and other factors: 
- Factors influencing employee turnover: 
- Recommendations for HR strategies based on the analysis:

## Tableau Visualization
I have created a visualization using Tableau to further explore the HR data. You can view the visualization [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/remigius.ufomba/viz/Book2_17081282084740/Dashboard1).

## Conclusion and Recommendations
### Conclusion:
After analyzing the HR data, it's evident that employee attrition is influenced by various factors such as job satisfaction, age, and work-life balance. Understanding these factors is crucial for devising effective retention strategies.

### Recommendations:
1. Implement initiatives to improve employee satisfaction, such as regular feedback sessions and opportunities for professional development.
2. Address any disparities in workload or compensation among different demographic groups to ensure equitable treatment.
3. Provide resources for employees to maintain a healthy work-life balance, such as flexible work hours or wellness programs.
4. Monitor key indicators of employee engagement and satisfaction regularly to identify potential issues early on and take proactive measures.
